<p> A waistcoat (UK and Commonwealth, /ˈwɛskət/ or /ˈweɪstkoʊt/;
 colloquially called a weskit[1]), or vest (US), is a sleeveless
  upper-body garment. It is usually worn over a dress shirt and
 necktie and below a coat as a part of most men's formal wear.
  It is also sported as the third piece in the traditional three-piece male
   suit.[2] Any given vest can be simple or ornate, or for leisure or luxury.[3]
    Historically, the vest can be worn either in the place of or underneath a 
    larger coat dependent upon the weather, wearer, and setting.</p>

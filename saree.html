<p>A sari (sometimes also shari or misspelled as saree)[note 1] 
is a women's garment from the Indian subcontinent[1] that consists
 of an unstitched drape varying from 4.5 to 9 metres (15 to 30 feet) 
 in length[2] and 600 to 1,200 millimetres (24 to 47 inches) in breadth[3] 
 that is typically wrapped around the waist, with one end draped over the 
 shoulder, partly baring the midriff.[4][5][6] It is traditionally worn in the 
 countries of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal. There are various
 styles of sari manufacture and draping, the most common being the Nivi style [7][8] The sari
 is worn with a fitted bodice commonly called a choli (ravike or kuppasa in southern India, 
 and cholo in Nepal) and a petticoat called ghagra, parkar, or ul-pavadai.[9] In the modern 
 Indian subcontinent, the sari is considered a cultural icon.[10] </p>

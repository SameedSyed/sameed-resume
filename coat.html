<p>A coat is a garment worn on the upper
 body by either gender for warmth or fashion.
  Coats typically have long sleeves and are 
  open down the front and closing by means 
of buttons, zippers, hook-and-loop fasteners,
 toggles, a belt, or a combination of some of 
 these. Other possible features include collars,
  shoulder straps and hoods.</p>

<p> A suit is a set of clothes comprising a suit jacket, or coat, and trousers.
 When of identical textile, and worn with a collared dress shirt, necktie,
 and dress shoes, it was traditionally considered informal wear in Western dress 
codes. The lounge suit originated in 19th-century Britain as more casual wear 
alternative for sportswear and British country clothing. After replacing the
black frock coat in the early 20th century as regular daywear, a sober one-coloured 
suit became known as a lounge suit. A darker, understated lounge suit for professional
occasions became known as a business suit. </p>

 <p>Suits are offered in different designs and constructions. Cut, and cloth, 
 whether two- or three-piece, single- or double-breasted, vary, in addition to 
 various accessories. A two-piece suit has a jacket and trousers, a three-piece 
 suit adds a waistcoat (known as a vest in North America).[2] Hats were almost 
 always worn outdoors (and sometimes indoors) with all men's clothes until the 
 counterculture of the 1960s in Western culture. Informal suits have been traditionally 
 worn with a fedora, a trilby, or a flat cap. Other accessories include handkerchief,
  suspenders or belt, watch, and jewelry. </p>
<br>
 <p>Other notable types of suits are for semi-formal occasions dinner suit (black tie) 
 and the black lounge suit (stroller), both which arose as less formal alternatives for 
 the formal wear of the dress coat for white tie, and the morning coat with formal trousers 
 for morning dress, respectively.</p>
 <p>Originally, suits were always tailor-made from the client's selected cloth. 
 These are now known as bespoke suits, custom-made to measurements, taste, and style
 preferences. Since the 1960s, most suits are mass-produced ready-to-wear garments. 
 Currently, suits are offered in roughly four ways: </p>
</div>
 <ul>
 <li>bespoke, in which the garment is custom-made by a tailor
 from a pattern created entirely from the customer's
  measurements, giving the best fit and free choice of 
  fabric; </li>
  <li>made to measure, in which a
   pre-made pattern is modified to fit the customer, and a 
   limited selection of options and fabrics is available; </li>
  <li> ready-to-wear, off-the-peg (Commonwealth English), or 
  off-the-rack (American English), which is sold as is, although
 some tailor alteration tends to be required;</li>
  <li>suit separates where lounge jacket and trousers are 
  sold separately in order to minimize alterations needed, 
  including also odd-coloured blazers or sports coats as smart 
  casual options </li>
 </ul>

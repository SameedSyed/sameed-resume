<p><i>A jumpsuit is a one-piece garment
 with sleeves and legs and typically without 
 integral coverings for feet, hands or head.
  The original jump suit is the functional 
  one-piece garment used by parachuters.

<p> The original
 skydivers' jumpsuits were simple garments designed to insulate the body from the colder
 temperature that's associated with higher altitudes and minimize the risk of covering important
 handles and grips. Today, however, the garment has found other uses.
Jumpsuits are generally regarded as 
a garment of convenience, especially for 
entertainers, as they are simpler, lighter and more flexible to wear. They have become
 more of a put on and remove garment than an ensemble outfit. However, unless the jumpsuit
  has an opening on the rear (a "drop seat"), it is necessary to remove it entirely for
   bathroom use.</p>

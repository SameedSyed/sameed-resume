<p>A polo shirt, tennis shirt, golf shirt 
or chukka shirt is a form of shirt with a 
collar, a placket neckline with two or three 
buttons, and an optional pocket. Polo shirts 
are usually short sleeved; they were used by 
polo players originally in India in 1859 and 
in Great Britain during the 1920s.</p>

<p>Polo shirts are usually made of 
knitted cotton (rather than woven cloth), 
usually a piqu√© knit, or less commonly an 
interlock knit (the latter used frequently, 
though not exclusively, with pima cotton polos), 
or using other fibers such as silk, merino wool, 
synthetic fibers, or blends of natural and synthetic 
fibers. A dress-length version of the shirt is called 
a polo dress. </p>

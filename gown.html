<p> A gown, from the Saxon word, gunna,[1] is a usually
 loose outer garment from knee- to full-length worn by men
  and women in Europe from the Early Middle Ages to the 17th 
  century, and continuing today in certain professions; later,
   gown was applied to any full-length woman's garment consisting 
   of a bodice and attached skirt. A long, loosely fitted gown called
 a Banyan was worn by men in the 18th century as an informal coat. </p>

 <p>The gowns worn today by academics, 
 judges, and some clergy derive directly 
 from the everyday garments worn by their 
 medieval predecessors, formalized into a
 uniform in the course of the 16th and 17th centuries.</p>

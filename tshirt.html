<i>A T-shirt, or tee shirt, is a style of 
fabric shirt named after the T shape of its 
body and sleeves. Traditionally, it has short
 sleeves and a round neckline, known as a crew
  neck, which lacks a collar. T-shirts are 
  generally made of a stretchy, light, and 
inexpensive fabric and are easy to clean. 
The T-shirt evolved from undergarments used 
in the 19th century and, in the mid-20th 
century, transitioned from undergarment 
to general-use casual clothing. </p>

<p> They are typically made of cotton 
textile in a stockinette or jersey knit, which has a distinctively pliable 
texture compared to shirts made of woven cloth. Some modern versions have a body made 
from a continuously knitted tube, produced on a circular knitting machine, such that the torso
 has no side seams. The manufacture of T-shirts has
 become highly automated and may include cutting fabric with a laser or a water jet.
T-shirts are inexpensive to produce and are often part of fast fashion, leading to outsized sales 
of T-shirts compared to other attire.[1] For example, two billion T-shirts are sold per year 
in the United States,[2] or the average person from Sweden buys nine T-shirts a year.[3] Production 
processes vary but can be environmentally intensive, and include the environmental impact caused by 
their
 materials, such as cotton which is both pesticide and water intensive.[4][5][6]

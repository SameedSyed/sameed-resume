<p> A sweater (North American English) or
 pullover, also called a jumper (British
 English and Australian English),[1] is a
 piece of clothing, typically with long
  sleeves, made of knitted or crocheted 
  material, that covers the upper part of 
  the body. When sleeveless, the garment is 
  often called a slipover or sweater vest. </p>

<p> Sweaters are worn by adults and
 children, often over a shirt, blouse,
 T-shirt, or another top, but sometimes
 next to the skin. Sweaters were
 traditionally made from wool but can
 now be made of cotton, synthetic
  fibers, or any combination of these. 
  There are also seasonal sweaters, which 
  around Christmas are called "ugly sweaters"</p>
